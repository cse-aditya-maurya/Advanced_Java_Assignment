Case Study: University Course Enrollment and Resource Analysis System
A university manages information about people associated with its academic system.
Each individual has common attributes such as id, name, department, and years of association.
To follow good object-oriented design:
•	A common abstract class represents shared attributes.
•	Student and Faculty extend this abstract class using inheritance.
•	All objects are stored using polymorphism in a List<Person> collection.
The university wants to analyze this data using the Java Stream API, without using traditional loops.
Stream API Tasks
1.	Display the names of all people sorted in alphabetical order.
2.	Find the department that has the highest number of people.
3.	Check whether any faculty member belongs to the Physics department.
4.	Create a list of unique departments available in the university.
5.	Display the top 3 longest-associated people with the university.
6.	Partition people into Students and Faculty and display the count of each group.
Constraints
•	Use Java Collections and Stream API only.
•	Do not use traditional loops (for, while).
•	Implement abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
•	Use suitable intermediate and terminal operations.
